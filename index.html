        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img class="pic" src="Assets/images/My Portrait.jpeg" alt="my portrait" width="200px" height="auto">
        <p> I was born in Boston, MA in 1980. I grew up in a small town called Bridgewater, MA and lived there until 2001 when I joined the U.S. Army as a Paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division. In 2006, after completing 3 combat tours, and almost 5 years
            of service, I received an honorable discharge at the rank of Sergeant, and moved to Coral Springs, FL.</p>
        <p> I started working for a security company, and worked my way up from a Security Officer to the Operations Director in two short years. I held the ranks of "Officer", "Post Captain", "Major", "Field Training Officer", and "Chief Field Training Officer"
            before obtaining the Directors postion. I worked there from 2006 until 2010 when my wife and I moved to where her family was located in Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p> Two years after that I started working at the University of Pennsylvania as a Gardener. I have worked at UPenn now for 7 years and that is where I learned of a course offered called "UPenn Coding Bootcamp". I am now enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp
            to explore my lifelong passion with computers and persue a career that I will love instead of just working for the money. This is a career path that I am very excited to explore.</p>
